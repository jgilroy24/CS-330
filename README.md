### __•	How do I approach designing software?__ ###
Computer graphics is a new subject for me. Although challenging, especially in the beginning, it is just like any other coding project as far as development is concerned. I add small pieces at a time, running the software frequently to ensure that every new piece works properly and does not adversely affect the rest of the application. Then, as the program grows and I see which lines are duplicated, I refactor the code into separate functions. The only difference with graphics is visualizing how to construct items using primitive objects.

Each program is a work in progress. It is unrealistic to believe that the code will not require refactoring. In this course, each milestone brought me closer to my finished scene. That was not simply adding code. It involved reorganizing and refactoring as well.

Computer graphics and visualization are intriguing, and I look forward to learning more in the future. SNHU has short, eight-week terms that did not leave much time to grasp all the nuances of OpenGL. It was a rush to get the stage constructed with all the requirements and within the specified period. Although I do not know if I will use graphics to create an entire 3D environment in my professional career, I will certainly dabble in a sandbox environment for pleasure.
